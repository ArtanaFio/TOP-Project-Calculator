NOTE TO DEVELOPER:

Things to Fix:
    --- Fix the number of decimals to a set amount to prevent overflow.
    --- Enable decimal and +/- buttons.
    --- Disable the decimal button after it is pressed such that it does not affect the     
        number.
    --- Re-enable the decimal button when the clear button is pressed.
