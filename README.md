NOTE TO DEVELOPER:

Things to Fix:
    --- Fix the number of decimal places to a set amount to prevent overflow (screen can 
        display up to 14-15 number places).
    --- Include a "backspace" button to undo typos.
    --- Include keyboard support.
    --- Fix the numberString issue that occurs after the equal button is pressed. 
    --- Remove the space that appears in the display screen after 9.
